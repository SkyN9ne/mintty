Building mintty requires gcc >= 3.x for Cygwin or MSYS. It can not be 
built with a MinGW compiler, because it relies on some Unix facilities 
that are not available on plain Windows, in particular pseudo terminal 
devices (ptys).

Building mintty on Cygwin requires pre-installing the 'gcc-core' and 'make' packages.

To compile, 'cd' into the 'src' subdirectory and run 'make'
To install, copy 'mintty.exe' from the 'bin' subdirectory to an appropriate place.
Mintty and Cygwin must be added to the %PATH% environment variable or moved to a location that is on %PATH%

See the top of the Makefiles for further make targets and options.
